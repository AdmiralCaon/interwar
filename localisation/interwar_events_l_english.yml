 iw_germany.1.d:0 "As a result of growing discontent of Ebert's government and Noske's movements against the Freikorps, Hermann Ehrhardt and his men seized control of Berlin in a military coup and installed Wolfgang Kapp as Reichskanzler.

 iw_germany.3.t:0 "The Unruly Free State"

 iw_germany.5.t:0 "France agrees to reduce the reparations of Versailles"
 iw_germany.5.d:0 "The Germans have appealed to the French to reduce the economic terms of the Treaty placed upon them. Typical of the French, they conceded to the whim of the Germans, citing economic benefit for all. How shall we react?"
 iw_germany.5.a:0 "They were quite harsh.."
 iw_germany.5.b:0 "And sponsor the death of another generation? Poppycock."
 iw_germany.6.t:0 "Our request is denied"
 iw_germany.6.d:0 "Neither London or Paris could reach an agreement together on the future of our own economy. They will continue to leech of our gains whilst we are left with nothing but the scraps and remains."

 iw_germany.11.t:0 "The French Refuse Rathenau's Terms"
 iw_germany.11.d:0 "Criticised by the Right and Ultranationalists for dealing with the French, Rathenau's terms appear to be just as unpopular with the French as they were with their own people as they will not budge."

 iw_germany.12.t:0 "The Germans Request Moratorium"
 iw_germany.12.d:0 "In a formal letter from the Reichstag, the Germans have again requested a reduction, or at the very least a delay to the payments they owe us due to the heavy taxing nature it has on their economy,"

 iw_germany.13.t:0 "The French Agree to Reduce and Delay the Payments"

 iw_germany.15.t:0 "Matthias Erzberger Murdered!"
 iw_germany.15.d:0 "Nationalism is proved to be a deadly evil once more as former Finance Minister Erzberger was murdered by Organisation Consul at Bad Griesbach earlier today.

 iw_germany.15.a:0 "Such barbaric violence is committed only by traitors and cowards."
